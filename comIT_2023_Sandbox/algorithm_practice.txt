# Let's develop an algorithm that requests the input of two
# numbers and calculate its product.

algorithm calculate_product
    var Number: number_1            #variable declaration and type of data (Number)
    var Number: number_2
    var Number: product

    print("Please enter the first number: ")
    read(number_1)

    print("Please enter the second number")
    read(number_2)

    print = number_1 * number_2
    
    print("The product of " + number_1 + " and " + number_2 + " was " + product)

end algorithm
