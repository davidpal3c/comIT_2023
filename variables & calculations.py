#Pieces of information can be labeled, stored, and accessed with variables!!
#Think of variables as boxes containing data. They let you store a value 
# by assigning it to a name. 
#Variables thus, have a NAME and a VALUE

#Ex.1
age=18
print=age

#Any type of value can be assigned to the variable
x = str(4)              #integer
y = int(3)              #string
z = float(3.5)          #float

print (x)
print (y)
print (z)

#or
print (x, y, z)


#Ex.2
#Variable with an operation
points=15
print(points*3)


#Simple calculation
first = float(input('First: '))
second = float(input('Second: '))
sum =  first + second
print("Sum: " + str(sum))
